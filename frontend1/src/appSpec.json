        "designSummary": "**The Playful Bento Box: A Fusion of Organized Density and Youthful Energy**\n\nThe Vision: ConnectHub is more than just a social media platform; it's a vibrant digital campus. The design aims to capture the energy and diversity of college life through a playful and engaging interface. We're using a Bento Grid layout to create a sense of organized density, allowing users to quickly scan and discover a variety of content. The dark theme is softened with playful colors and rounded elements, creating a welcoming and approachable atmosphere.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The Bento Grid as a Foundation: The primary layout is a Bento Grid, with modules of varying sizes to accommodate different content types (posts, events, widgets).\n2. Playful Color Accents: Use a limited palette of bright, contrasting colors to highlight key elements and create a sense of fun. These colors should be carefully chosen to ensure accessibility on the dark background.\n3. Rounded Corners and Subtle Shadows: Soften the overall look with rounded corners on all cards and containers. Add subtle shadows to create depth and visual interest.\n4. Interactive Elements: Incorporate hover effects and micro-interactions to make the interface feel responsive and engaging.",

We're using a Bento Grid layout to create a sense of organized density, allowing users to quickly scan and discover a variety of content. The dark theme is softened with playful colors and rounded elements, creating a welcoming and approachable atmosphere.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The Bento Grid as a Foundation: The primary layout is a Bento Grid, with modules of varying sizes to accommodate different content types (posts, events, widgets).\n2. Playful Color Accents: Use a limited palette of bright, contrasting colors to highlight key elements and create a sense of fun. These colors should be carefully chosen to ensure accessibility on the dark background.\n3. Rounded Corners and Subtle Shadows: Soften the overall look with rounded corners on all cards and containers. Add subtle shadows to create depth and visual interest.\n4. Interactive Elements: Incorporate hover effects and micro-interactions to make the interface feel responsive and engaging.",

Components must be functional, use React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext for global state). Accessibility: semantic HTML, ARIA where needed. No backend, but include a brief backend suggestion (Node/Express + MongoDB or Firebase). Include a short README: install, run dev server, add Tailwind to Vite.
